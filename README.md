This project looks at a mathematical and applied calculation of optimal point estimators, estimator comparisons and hypothesis test-based confidence intervals for the exponential distribution. This was a group effort performed as part of the 'BST 222 - Basics of Statistical Inference' course in Fall 2017 at Harvard University.

The major foci of the project were:
- Maximum Likelihood Estimation
- Unbiased Maximum Likelihood Estimation
- Method of Moments estimators and their variation over degree and sample size
- Wald Confidence Interval
- Bootstrap Confidence Interval
- Gamma Confidence Interval
- Score Confidence Interval
